# actualStreamerSize / actualPpSize / ppBot

My friend Evan ([Evan's Twitch here](https://twitch.tv/evanwahr)) tricked me into typing "!actualppsize" in his chat, so I made a bot that tells viewers his actual pp size.

In other words, ppBot is a Twitch chatbot that replies to users with various statements about Evan's penis. The replies are randomly selected from a list of responses I wrote by hand. Some of these reponses include embedded variables that reference other members of our friend group.
